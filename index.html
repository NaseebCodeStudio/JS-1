            <b>JavaScript</b> is a high-level, interpreted programming language
            that is commonly used in web development to add interactivity and
            dynamic behavior to websites. It is primarily known for its ability
            to manipulate the content of web pages in real-time, allowing
            developers to create interactive user interfaces, handle user input,
            and communicate with web servers asynchronously.
            <b>JavaScript</b> is supported by all major web browsers and has a
            wide range of applications, including web development, server-side
            development (Node.js), game development, and mobile app development.
            <br>
            <span style="color: red"
              >Browsers are equipped with engines designed to interpret
              JavaScript code. Following 2016, Ryan Dahl utilized C++ to develop
              the Node.js runtime environment, which operates as a JavaScript
              engine outside of the browser. Notable JavaScript engines include
              V8 (used by Chrome and Node.js), SpiderMonkey (used by Firefox),
              and JavaScriptCore (used by Safari).</span

          <p>
            Here's a brief explanation of the differences between text editors,
            compilers, IDEs, and runtime environments: <br />

            <b>1. Text Editor:</b> <br />
            - A text editor is a software application used for creating and
            editing plain text files. <br />
            - Text editors are lightweight and primarily focused on editing
            code, offering features such as syntax highlighting, code
            indentation, and search/replace functionality. <br />
            - Examples include Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, Atom, and
            Notepad++. <br />

            <b>2. Compiler:</b> <br />
            - A compiler is a software tool that translates source code written
            in a high-level programming language into machine code or
            intermediate code. <br />
            - It converts the entire source code into an executable file or
            another form that can be run by the computer's operating system.
            <br />
            - Compilers are commonly used in compiled languages like C, C++, and
            Java. <br />
            - Examples include GCC (GNU Compiler Collection), Clang, and
            Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler. <br />

            <b>3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE):</b> <br />
            - An IDE is a software application that provides comprehensive tools
            and features for software development in one integrated environment.
            <br />
            - It typically includes a text editor, compiler or interpreter,
            debugger, and other tools for building, testing, and debugging
            software. <br />
            - IDEs often provide features like code completion, syntax checking,
            and project management capabilities. <br />
            - Examples include Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and Xcode.
            <br />

            <b>4. Runtime Environment:</b> <br />
            - A runtime environment is a software framework that provides the
            infrastructure for running and executing programs written in a
            specific programming language. <br />
            - It includes libraries, components, and tools necessary to execute
            the code and manage resources during program execution. <br />
            - Runtime environments can be specific to a programming language
            (e.g., Java Runtime Environment for running Java programs) or a
            platform (e.g., Node.js runtime environment for running JavaScript
            outside the browser). <br />
            - Examples include Java Runtime Environment (JRE), .NET Common
            Language Runtime (CLR), and Node.js runtime. <br />

        <div class="content">
          <p>
            JavaScript and ECMAScript (ES) are often used interchangeably, but
            there are distinctions between the two: <br />

            <b>JavaScript:</b> <br />
            <b>1.</b> JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web
            development for creating interactive and dynamic content on
            websites. <br />
            <b>2.</b> It was initially developed by Netscape and first
            introduced in 1995. <br />
            <b>3.</b> JavaScript implementations may include additional features
            beyond the ECMAScript standard, such as browser-specific APIs (e.g.,
            DOM manipulation, AJAX). <br />
            <b>4.</b> JavaScript is widely supported by web browsers and used
            extensively in client-side scripting. <br />

            <b>ECMAScript (ES):</b> <br />
            <b>1.</b> ECMAScript is a standard specification for scripting
            languages, with JavaScript being the most popular implementation of
            this standard. <br />
            <b>2.</b> It is maintained by Ecma International and formalized
            through the ECMAScript Language Specification. <br />
            <b>3.</b> ECMAScript defines the syntax, semantics, and behavior of
            the JavaScript language. <br />
            <b>4.</b> JavaScript implementations conform to specific versions of
            the ECMAScript standard (e.g., ECMAScript 5, ECMAScript 6/ES2015,
            ECMAScript 2016, etc.). <br />
            <b>5.</b> ECMAScript provides the foundation for JavaScript and
            serves as a reference for other scripting languages.
            <br />
            <b>In summary</b>, JavaScript is a specific implementation of the
            ECMAScript standard, which defines the syntax and features of the
            language. Other scripting languages may also conform to the
            ECMAScript standard, but JavaScript remains the most widely used and
            recognized implementation.

        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Here we are going to learn four ways to write JavaScript code using these simple functions for having result(alert("here your text!");):
            <br />

            <b>1.</b> Using an HTML file with the &lt;script&gt; element. Similar to
            CSS, JavaScript can be written inside this script tag. <br />
            <b>2.</b> Using an external file linked with an HTML file using the same
            &lt;script&gt; tag and including the `src` attribute. <br />
            <b>3.</b> Using an external file and running it with the Node.js(download and install) runtime
            environment via the terminal. <br />
            <b>4.</b> Using a browser. Right-click, select inspect, and use the console
            tab to write JavaScript. <br />

            
            <span style="color: red; text-align: center; display: block;"
              >Good practice is to always write or link JavaScript at the end of
              the HTML content, just before closing the body tag.

            <b>2.</b> alert(): This method displays a dialog box with a message to the user. <br>
            <span style="color: red;">alert("Hello, NaseebCodeStudio!");</span> <br>


            <b>3.</b> document.write(): This method writes HTML content directly to the document.<br>
            <span style="color: red;">document.write("Hello, NaseebCodeStudio!");</span> <br>


            <b>4.</b> innerHTML: This property sets or returns the HTML content of an element. <br>
            <span style="color: red;">document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = "Hello, NaseebCodeStudio!";</span> <br>


            <b>5.</b> window.print(): this method is used to print the current page. <br>
            <span style="color: red;">window.print();</span> <br>
